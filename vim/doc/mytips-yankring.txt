(from Steve Losh)

Vim's copying and pasting functionality (which uses registers) is very, very
powerful, but itâ€™s not exactly "user friendly". The YankRing plugin adds a lot
more power, but also adds a few features that make copying and pasting much
more pleasant.

For example, after you paste some text you can replace that paste with the
previous item you copied with Ctrl-P. You can cycle back further by just
hitting Ctrl-P over and over.

YankRing also shares your yanked text between Vim windows, which makes things
"just work" when you want to paste text from one window into another.

You can also show a list of all your previously yanked text with :YRShow.
Mapping that command to a key is quite helpful:

  nnoremap <silent> <F3> :YRShow<cr>
  inoremap <silent> <F3> <ESC>:YRShow<cr>

YankRing offers a ton of other cool functionality but I haven't had the time
or motivation to really dig in and find out how to use it.
